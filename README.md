# BOTSH-Building-Topology-Ontology-for-Smart-Homes

Building Topology Ontology for Smart Homes (BOTSH) is an interoperable ontology developed based on BOT and customized specifically to the domain of smart homes. There are around 8 classes and 15 properties. It is completely aligned with Smart Home and Building Ontology (BOSH) which is a domain ontology for smart homes consisting of sensors, actuators, appliances, observations and measurements.

#### The ontology is available at http://purl.org/botsh
#### The ontology documentation is available at http://purl.org/botsh/documentation

## BOTSH - Demo

To evaluate the BOTSH and to demonstrate the advantages of aligning BOTSH with BOSH, we have developed a sample demo which uses a Duplex House BIM model. The instances are modelled for the same and evaluated through a set of competency questions.

Application demo available at http://botsh.pythonanywhere.com/
